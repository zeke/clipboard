The scripts I keep in my [~/.clipboard](http://npm.im/dot-clipboard) directory

## Scripts

There's only [one script](/index.js) so far. It writes all text-based clipboard events to a file:

```
» ls -A1
2015-05-08-18:28:29:052-Fri.txt
2015-05-08-18:28:36:088-Fri.txt

» cat 2015-05-08-18:28:36:088-Fri.txt
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door —
Only this, and nothing more.
```
